## Installation

To install modules run

```

 npm i

```

You will need to run the schema file to create your database in MySQL to make this app function.

## Usage

This app will allow you to view a table of the entire organization, employees by department as well as employees by manager.

New employees are added by department, then the role and manager must be updated.

If an employee does not report to anyone their manager will display as null, and must be updated as such upon promotion.
